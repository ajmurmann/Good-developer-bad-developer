Good Developer, Bad Developer
==================================
This document is heavily influenced by a similar [document Ben Horrowitz wrote many years ago for product managers](http://a16z.com/2012/06/15/good-product-managerbad-product-manager/) and that was also printed in his book "The Hard Thing About Hard Things: Building a Business When There Are No Easy Answers" as well as on a modified version that was co-authored by [David Weiden](http://www.khoslaventures.com/wp-content/uploads/Good_Product_Manager_Bad_Product_Manager_KV.pdf)

The original article was [recently discussed on Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=10368094). Someone mentioned a version for engineers and I immediately wanted to write my own version.

Right now it's only a list, but I might expand on some of these points if more clarity is needed.

Good developers understand their code and the environment it lives in
---------------------------------------------------------------------
* Good developers understand the code they are writing and it's implications
* Bad developers cargo cult other people's code without understanding the reasoning behind the patterns used
* Very bad developers copy code without understanding how it works
* Good developers understand that writing code is chosing between trade offs and know there is no perfect code. The main trade offs are between the following axis
  * Runtime Performance
  * Time spent writing the system
  * Maintainability
  * Readability
  * Extensibility
* Bad developers are not able to see the trade offs
* Bad developers might see the trade offs but do not assess which one is the right one given the context the code is written in and will live in
* Bad developers write code that's too clever, not targeting one of the important quality axis, but making themselves feel smart

Adapting to changing technology
-------------------------------
* Good developers keep learning about new technologies and methodologies
* Bad developers settle for what they know
* Very bad developers fight new things they don't understand because they don't want to change/learn
* Good developers are careful when choosing new technologies and make sure that the major trade offs are known before using new technology on any critical project
* Bad developers believe a new technology is a  silver bullet
* Bad developers use new technology on critical projects before they understand the trade offs represented by the technology

Good developers communicate
------------------------------
* Good developers ask for help
  * When they are stuck
  * When a design decision will have long term consequences and more smart people should weigh in
* Bad developers waste time being stuck when others could have helped them
* Bad developers unilaterally make long term design decisions that they aren't sure about
* Good developers are eager to share heir knowledge
* Bad developers are interested in looking smarter than other people on their team
* Great developers can explain different solutions the team might want to consider to product managers and designers 
* Bad developers get frustrated with product managers and designers
* Great developers provide tooling to make the entire team more productive
* Good developers can give a rough estimate how long an effort will take and know when they can't give an estimate
* Bad developers keep promising they will be done "soon"
* Great developers work with product on setting and achieving realistic targets
* Bad developers know targets set by the business are unrealistic, but remain quiet an let the train hit the wall
